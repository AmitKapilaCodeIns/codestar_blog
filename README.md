# django-blog

ðŸš€ Live Site: [Visit the Blog](https://amit-project-blog-26917aa27608.herokuapp.com)

I created this blog project to showcase my knowledge and skills in Django web development, deployment, and modern software practices.

---

## Features Demonstrated

- Create a **database-backed Django project** and deploy it to **Heroku**  
- Host uploaded images on a **cloud provider (Cloudinary)**  
- Build **function-based views** in Django  
- Use **Django generic views**  
- Add **authentication** (sign up, login, logout)  
- Create **custom models**  
- Add extra interactivity with **JavaScript**  
- Create multiple Django apps (e.g., blog + About page)  
- Build a **full-featured Admin section** to manage comments

## Design Thinking & Agile Approach

This project was developed using **Design Thinking** and **Agile principles**.

- Before building the blog, I created **User Stories in GitHub Projects** and tracked them on a Kanban board with acceptance criteria.  
- The **User Stories** guided functionality as it was added.  
- I focused on the **user experience** by asking questions such as:  
  - Why would a user wish to visit our blog?  
  - What will make them return?  
- I researched real blogs to identify best practices.  
- With any blog, **content is king** â€“ so I avoided obstacles to accessing posts.  
- The sign-up process is **easy and frictionless**, enabling users to engage meaningfully.  

**Problem Statement:**  
How do I develop a blog application that provides this functionality to a user?  

This problem statement informed the user stories and development process.

## Blog Overview

This full-featured blog application demonstrates how to build and scale a Django project.

- Users can:  
  - Register an account (username + password, optional email)  
  - Log in to view posts  
  - Leave, edit, or delete comments  
- Admins can:  
  - Manage comments via a dedicated admin section  

The project highlights:  

- **Multiple Django apps** (Blog + About page)  
- **Deployment** with Heroku  
- **Database management** with ElephantSQL  
- **Media storage** using Cloudinary for blog images

## Purpose

I built this blog both to:  

1. **Showcase my skills** as a software developer.  
2. **Share tips and tricks** with other budding developers.  

The same Django principles and mechanics I learned while building this blog can be applied to many other projects.
